                        <p>Hi, I am student enrolled in a computer science class. Where I get to create a website using HTML and CSS,
                        I also get to do a lot of other fun activities involving programming. Some other projects involving computer science,
                        were calculating Pi using Python 3, and a scratch project that shows you the parts of the brain.(Both projects are in the pictures the below.)
                        I also like building computers, soccer, video games, books, water tubing and science</p>
