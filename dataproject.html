    <h1>DATA PROJECT</h1>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <h5>Define your problem</h5>
          <p>The Problem I'm trying to solve with data is, how much should your computer cost based on your needs. So to fix that problem,
          is to create a survey that estimates the amount your computer should cost, and being a PC builder myself, I know quite alot about
          the industry.</p>
      <h5>Preparing to collect the data</h5>
        <p>So to collect my data I made a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9wccmk4">survey</a>, so when the questions are in I would use
        google spreadsheets with all the prices on it and add it up(<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y82qc2ys">link</a>). Of coruse if I
        had alot more time I would use Python 3 to put it all in one place, so for now I just show you the data.</p>
