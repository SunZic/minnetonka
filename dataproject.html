    <h1>DATA PROJECT</h1>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <h5>Define your problem</h5>
          <p>The Problem I'm trying to solve with data is, how much should your computer cost based on your needs. So to fix that problem,
          is to create a survey that estimates the amount your computer should cost, and being a PC builder myself, I know quite alot about
          the industry.</p>
