    <h1>DATA PROJECT</h1>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <h5>Define your problem</h5>
          <p>The Problem I'm trying to solve with data is, how much should your computer cost based on your needs. So to fix that problem,
          is to create a survey that estimates the amount your computer should cost, and being a PC builder myself, I know quite alot about
          the industry.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <h5>Preparing to collect the data</h5>
        <p>So to collect my data I made a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9wccmk4">survey</a>, so when the questions are in, I would use
        google spreadsheets with all the prices on it and add it up(<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y82qc2ys">link</a>). Of course if I
        had a lot more time I would use Python 3 to put it all in one place, so, for now, I'll just show you the data.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <h5>Cleaning my data/ Problems you have or will have with the data</h5>
        <p>My only problems are that the PC/tech industry, are constantly making new things and prices, so you would have to update prices and
        specifications(Refresh Rates, Resolutions, Storage, RAM and much more). Also, a downside is that the big company's have deals
        with the company's that make the hardware and software because they buy it in bulk, and because I'm looking at the prices from
         the consumer side, prices might be higher.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <h5>What could I automate</h5>
        <p>Though, I could automate the choice just by using the first question of the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9wccmk4">survey</a>.
        But it would really reduce the customization.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <h5>The DATA!!</h5>
